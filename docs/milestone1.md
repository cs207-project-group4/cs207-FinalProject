# Report for Milestone 1

# Introduction
This project aims at building a software library for **Automatic Differentiation**, or **AD**.
The goal of AD is to provide an **accurate** estimate of the derivative of a given function. It combines the advantages of 
Numerical Methods such as Finite Differences, and the Symbolic Computing that builds a symbolic expression of the derivative. 
AD is able to compute an approximation of the derivative of a function, **without computing a symbolic expression** of the derivative and 
with an **accuracy of machine precision**.

AD has many applications accross Science and Engineering, the most popular one these days being Deep Neural Networks. These models 
try to fit a function with >10M parameters to a dataset. To do so, they use Gradient Descent algorithms using gradients approximations provided
by AD. Famous applications include **Alpha Go**, **Self-Driving Cars** and **Image Recognition**.

# How to Use FancyProjectName ?

```
You can include code-like markdown like this : 
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
